If a variable is declared and assigned in one statement then the statement is split into two, with only the declaration getting hoisted.</p><h2>Declared vs Assigned</h2><p>First, you must understand the difference between declaring and assigning a variable. Consider the following example:</p><pre><code>var a = 27; // is both a declaration and an assignment</code></pre><p>The variable a is declared like this:</p><pre><code>var a</code></pre><p>and assigned like this:</p><pre><code>a = 27</code></pre><p>JavaScript hoisting applies to declarations NOT assignments.</p><h2>Hoisting Variables</h2><p>Consider the following code:</p><pre><code>(function (){
  console.log(a); // returns undefined
  var a = "This is a Local Variable";
})();</code></pre><p>Ok. So why is the console.log(a); returns undefined? Well, enters JavaScript variable hoisting, and your code will actually end up looking like below.</p><pre><code>(function (){
  var a; // declaration moved to the top
  console.log(a); 
  a = "This is a Local Variable"; // left in place
})();</code></pre><p>As mentioned earlier, hoisting moves variable declarations to the top of its containing scope. As a result, variable a was declared, it was automatically hoisted to the top of the function scope above the console.log(a). However, assignment stays where it is!</p><h2>Avoiding Hoisting Issues</h2><p>Hoisting is a concept that really defines how JavaScript actually works. But it can get you into many types of troubles. To prevent that, what you can - and should - do is, write your code as closely as possible to how JavaScript will interpret it. This means always declare your variables at the top of every scope. This will increase readability, limit the number of bugs or errors your code may have and decrease confusion among other teammates in trying to fix bugs or errors.</p></div></div></section></div></body></html>
