          <h1><span>Tools</span> I can’t work without</h1>
          <p>As a frontend designer and developer, I have loads of tools and softwares that I use on a daily basis. But these are the tools I really can't work without.</p>
          <h2>Sublime Text</h2>
          <p>I use Sublime Text every day and absolutely swear by it. It's simple, fast, efficient, and very capable. As a web developer we routinely perform some tasks such as navigating files, running tools, text editing, and searching and replacing text etc, sublime text simplifies all those tasks, automating them, and saving crucial time and effort. It supports cross-platform, I use it on my Windows Desktop and on my MacBook Pro, which is the great thing about it. It has wonderful syntax highlighting, a slough of attractive color schemes. It is one of the most powerful code editors with amazing features and and it can be even more powerful by installing Plugins or Packages.</p>
          <h2>Chrome Developer Tools</h2>
          <p>Well, Chrome Developer Tools are every developer’s best friend and I am not an exception. I use it absolutely all day long, and it saves me hours every day relative to working without it. Chrome Developer Console is a powerful tool for debugging and optimizing your code. WI use Elements panel to debug my HTML and CSS stuff. It not only allow me to review the DOM tree itself, but on the right, I can also see a list of the styles that match each particular element. Awesome feature! It's Sources panel is my go-to place for JavaScript debugging. It lets us view the code, un-minify it, set breakpoints, step through/in/out functions and all the other great things that are available through the V8 Debugger. It's almost like an in browser IDE! I use Network panel to review the overall performance of my webpages. This is an invaluable feature for me that helps to optimize my webpage performance.</p>
          <h2>GitHub</h2>
          <p>I see no reason to not use a version control platform like Github. </p>
          <h2>Slack</h2>
          <p>Well, I guess everyone is using Slack these days and it’s just a perfect tool to communicate with colleagues and even customers. It’s super easy to learn, but can be pretty powerful if you learn all these tricks like reminders, commands and even custom emojis. Who doesn’t like custom emojis?</p>
