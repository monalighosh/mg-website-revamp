          <h1><span>Tools</span> I can’t work without</h1>
          <p>As a frontend designer and developer, I have loads of tools and softwares that I use on a daily basis. But these are the tools I really can't work without.</p>
          <h2>Sublime Text</h2>
          <p>I use Sublime Text every day and absolutely swear by it. It's simple, fast, efficient, and very capable. As a web developer we routinely perform some tasks such as navigating files, running tools, text editing, and searching and replacing text etc, sublime text simplifies all those tasks, automating them, and saving crucial time and effort. It supports cross-platform, I use it on my Windows Desktop and on my MacBook Pro, which is the great thing about it. It has wonderful syntax highlighting, a slough of attractive color schemes. It is one of the most powerful code editors with amazing features and and it can be even more powerful by installing Plugins or Packages.</p>
          <h2>Chrome Developer Tools</h2>
          <p>Well, Chrome Developer Tools are every developer’s best friend and I am not an exception. I use it absolutely all day long, and it saves me hours every day relative to working without it. Chrome Developer Console is a powerful tool for debugging and optimizing your code. I use Elements panel to debug my HTML and CSS stuff. It not only allows me to review the DOM tree itself, but I can also see a list of the styles that match each particular element. Awesome feature! It's Sources panel is my go-to place for JavaScript debugging. It lets us view the code, un-minify it, set breakpoints, step through/in/out functions and all the other great things that are available through the V8 Debugger. It's almost like an in browser IDE! I use Network panel to review the overall performance of my webpages. This is an invaluable feature for me that helps to optimize my webpage performance.</p>
          <h2>GitHub</h2>
          <p>I see no reason to not use a version control platform like Github. As a developer you can't avoid using GitHub daily, either to host your own code or to make use of other people's code. At first I was a bit intimidated by Github workflow. However, I must say, it's a real gem when it comes to productivity. Now I never create anything without Github. I use it daily to organize my projects, manage projects' code, issues, tasks that had to be done, team collaboration, list is endless. </p>
          <h2>Slack</h2>
          <p>Well, I guess everyone is using Slack these days. It makes communication easier between team mates, also improves collaboration with a few advanced features. It's easy to learn, you can create &amp; share code snippets, integrate your github account with slack, it's a great project management tool and the most important you can  create custom emojis. This is so cool  &#9787;.</p>
          <h2>CodePen</h2>
          <p>CodePen describes themselves as a "playground for the front-end side of the web.". They surely are! They provide awesome features to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You can choose to include normalize or reset, autoprefixer and prefix-free mode for your css, you can use HTML preprocessor such as Pag, Markdown, JavaScript preprocessor such as babel, CoffeeScript etc, you can customize fonts, themes, project views and what not. It is smartly designed so that everything is at your fingertips. That makes your job easy and helps to create a faster workflow. Above all it is a great place to find new inspirations.</p>
